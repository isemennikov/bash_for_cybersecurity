Exercises for Chapter #2
1. Experiment with the uname command and see what it outputs:
personal operating systems. Rewrite the osdetect.sh script to
use the uname command with one of its options. Attention: in different operations
Not all options are available on online systems.

2. Modify the osdetect.sh script to use the function. Place
the if/then/else logic inside the function and then called from the script. At the very
there should be no output from the function. Draw the conclusion from the main part of the script.

3. Set the osdetect.sh script to execute permissions (see man chmod),
so that you can run it without using bash as the first
words on the command line. How do you call the script now?

4. Write a script called argcnt.sh that reports the number of transmitted
arguments added to it:

    Modify your script to also output each argument one at a time
in line.

    Modify the script so that each argument is marked with the following
at once:
$ bash argcnt.sh this is a "real live" test
there are 5 arguments
arg1: this
arg2: is
arg3:a
arg4: real live
arg5: test
$

5. Modify argcnt.sh so that it only prints even-numbered arguments.
